# Microsoft & OpenAPI

Microsoft is one of the original members of the [OpenAPI Initiative](https://openapis.org) and has actively contributed to the development of the OpenAPI specification since 2015. Many Microsoft products provide support for OpenAPI descriptions. OpenAPI descriptions are also used extensively within Microsoft to describe internal APIs.
